# Thread simulator

[Thread simulator](https://raisinten.github.io/Thread_Simulator/) has been made to approximate the motion of a thread pulled and to record the trace of all the points of the thread. It is still under construction, but it is really fun to play with nevertheless.

Here is a snapshot of an amazing artwork you can make by simply stroking the canvas!
